Description: A simple package with a specific use-case: The creation of an image
  composite of spatially and temporally unaligned earth observation data. This
  package supplies you with a single function based on the gdalcubes package 
  which is highly customizable to your project needs. You can almost certainly
  make it work with any mulit-spectral data set and control how you temporallly
  aggregate your data to get a mono- or multi-temporal wall-to-wall coverage
  of your study area.
